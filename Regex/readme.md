## CARD VALIDATOR USING REGEX

## HOW IT WORKS
- Each of the credit card companies uses a different number format. Here's a code to allow users to enter a number without specifying a company; the company can be determined from the number. 

- The format for each company is:

## Visa
13 or 16 digits, starting with 4.

## MasterCard
16 digits, starting with 51 through 55.

## American Express
15 digits, starting with 34 or 37.
